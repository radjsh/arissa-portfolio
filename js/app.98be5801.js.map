AirPay is a mobile wallet that allows users to easily access digital payment service for their daily transactions. In the digital payments team, we focused on designing payment features such as virtual wish cards, digital services categories, easy bill enhancement and contactless NFC payments. I was involved in the research, problem definition, ui/ux design and pre-launch ui review stages.\n        </div>\n        <section class=\"posters\">\n            <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">In order to personalise the user to user transaction experience, we decided to include virtual wish cards in the “transfer” page, for users to attach to their payments. These wish cards included fun and cheerful messages for the different occasions. We had to consider how users on both ends would view the wish cards under the different scenarios. </div>\n            <poster :key=\"vwc.title\" :poster=\"vwc\"></poster>\n            <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

For this feature, I created many different design iterations, with reference to competitor apps such as AliPay and JD Finance, while staying true to AirPay’s style. </div>\n            <poster :key=\"dpc.title\" :poster=\"dpc\"></poster>\n            <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">This feature allows users to pay their bills to third party merchants through an automatic rotation agreement. This means that if one payment method fails, the application would automatically try to process the payment with the next payment method. I led the ui design of this feature, creating all the necessary screens and flows. </div>\n            <poster :key=\"easybills.title\" :poster=\"easybills\"></poster>\n            <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">From our customer feedback and competitor analysis, we found that most customers are unaware of the difference between “scan” and “pay”, commonly mistaking one for the other. To minimise this mistake, we decided to merge the features into one page. For this feature, I redesigned the homepage, including the home icons, as well as the scan and pay page. </div>\n            <poster :key=\"saps.title\" :poster=\"saps\"></poster>\n            <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

To make the top up experience more seamless, a pop up would appear if users do not have enough money, instead of redirecting them to a new page.

'overview-m reveal' : 'overview reveal']\">\n            Hop is a mobile application designed to <b>help parents discover, compare, and book enrichment classes for their children with confidence</b>. \n            \n             <br><br>In 2021, I worked with ME Techd devlopers and Hop's founder as the sole product UI/UX designer, owning research, end-to-end experience design, and building interactive prototypes for dev handoff.\n\n            <br><br>I revisited the project in 2026 to see how my thinking has evolved, reflect critically on my work, and redesign with new insights.\n        </div>\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Original Approach</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            We defined our target audience as <b>millennial parents with children aged 1–12</b>. The founder had previously conducted exploratory interviews to validate the demand for children's enrichment bookings. Given the tight product launch timeline, I synthesised those early insights, mapped out the end-to-end user journey, and identified key pain points to prioritise what we could ship for the MVP.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"userJourney\" :poster=\"userJourney\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            Information about enrichment classes is fragmented across the internet, making it <b>tedious and time-consuming</b> for parents to search, compare and book classes.        </div>\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Where It Fell Short</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            After revisiting the project and conducting secondary research across parenting forums and blogs, I recognised a critical gap in the product's framing.\n            \n            <br><br>The initial design focused heavily on task completion, but not the emotional weight behind decision-making. Choosing enrichment classes, especially for young children, is not simply a booking problem, but rather a huge trust decision. Parents are evaluating <b>credibility, safety and the long-term impact on their child</b>. While the product helped parents complete actions, it did not sufficiently <b>reduce anxiety or build confidence</b>.\n\n            <br><br>From my research, here are some of the concerns that surfaced:\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"themes\" :poster=\"themes\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            This shifted the focus of the product from: <b>“Helping parents find classes”</b> to <b>“Helping parents feel confident and safe in their decision.”</b>\n        </div>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Emotional Journey Map</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            I reconstructed the customer journey map, this time mapping not just actions, but also their emotional states and doubts.\n            <br><br>What became clear was that the highest friction points were not during searching for classes, but rather <b>shortlisting and deciding which classes to choose</b>.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"ejm\" :poster=\"ejm\"></poster>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Revised Problem Statement</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'overview-m reveal' : 'overview reveal']\">\n            How might we reduce the <b>cognitive and emotional burden</b> parents face when choosing enrichment classes?\n        </div> \n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Design Evolution</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n        After identifying that trust and confidence were core to parents’ decision-making, I ran a short prioritisation survey with 8 parents of young children to understand what factors mattered most when choosing between similar classes.\n\n        <br><br><b>Distance</b> and <b>reviews</b> consistently ranked highest, followed by <b>cost</b> and <b>schedule fit</b>.\n\n        Rather than directly mirroring the ranking, I did a deeper analysis on what these factors represented and how they can fit in the filtering and sorting system.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"factors\" :poster=\"factors\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n        I first tested this structure through a low-fidelity prototype to validate hierarchy and information grouping before committing to visual design.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"lofi\" :poster=\"lofi\"></poster>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Components Library</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            Back in 2021, I built a component library to ensure consistency in design, and efficiency in development. It included color systems, typography, and commonly used elements such as buttons, toasts and tabs.\n\n            <br><br> For this revamp, I built upon this design system rather than starting from scratch. This allowed me to maintain brand familiarity, speed up iteration and focus on improving interaction logic instead of reinventing a visual language.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"designLibrary\" :poster=\"designLibrary\"></poster>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">High Fidelity Protoype</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            For the filter, I reordered the factors based on my defined hierarchy and focused on elimination first and refinement second.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"filter\" :poster=\"filter\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            For the list of classes, I decluttered the top tab to prioritise showing 'filters', 'sort by' and 'date'. I also rearranged the information on class cards to prioritise key information.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"classListing\" :poster=\"classListing\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            I added a new 'Sort By' tab that allows users to sort based on reviews, distance, cost and start time.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"sort\" :poster=\"sort\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            I redesigned the leave a review component from a pop-up toast to a full-screen UI, with purposeful prompts and examples to help parents leave substantial reviews.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"leaveReviews\" :poster=\"leaveReviews\"></poster>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            Previously, 'Reviews' were just an afterthought and did not reflect much on each class's listing page.

As a result, I did not have access to the original user base or live product data to validate the design.\n\n            <br><br>To test my updated approach, I conducted short interviews with 8 parents to gather directional feedback on the redesigned flows and priotisation logic.

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            <b>2021 MVP Constraints</b>\n            <br>Due to launch timelines, the team prioritised building the booking infrastructure and calendar management. Features such as reviews and advanced sorting logic were simplified and depriotised. \n\n            <br><br>\n            <b>2026 Redesign Trade-offs</b>\n            <br>In this revisit, I prioritised <b>filtering, sorting and review credibility</b> as they addressed the core emotional pain-points. Features such as <b>instructor verification badges, smart recommendations and sentiment tagging</b> were intentionally scoped out to maintain focus on the highest trust-impact levers.\n\n        </div>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Reflections</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            Revisiting this project five years later, I realised that my initial approach focused heavily on the transactional aspect of booking a class – optimising the steps needed to complete the task efficiently. While functional clarity is important, I had overlooked the emotional weight behind parents' decision-making process.\n\n            <br><br>Through further research, it became clear that parents are not simply evaluating logistics such as distance or schedule. They are making high-stakes decisions about their children's development, and rely heavily on reviews, credibility signals and reassuarance before feeling confident enough to commit.\n\n            <br><br>With this shift in insight, the redesign focuses not only on <b>improving filtering and sorting mechanics</b>, but on <b>reducing anxiety through stronger trust signals and a more intentional review system</b>.\n\n            <br><br>Revisiting older work has reminded me that good product design is not just about usability, but about understanding the emotional context in which decisions are made, and continuously refining solutions as our perspective evolves.\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"see-more-div\">\n            <text :class=\"[mobileView ?

'header-2-m' : 'header-2']\">The Design Process</header>\n\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m' : 'introduction']\">\n            My first consideration was to ensure that the thickness of the worm was consistent across the design of the characters and symbols. To do so, I used an outline brush set to a fixed size on procreate. I hand-drew all the characters and avoided any smart snapping or lines that were too straight, to stay true to the organic nature of a worm.\n        </div>\n\n        <img src=\"@/assets/worm-squirm/ws-4.jpg\" class=\"img3\"/>\n\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m' : 'introduction']\">\n            I then filled in the outline for the glyphs and started marking out the worm's lines. My plan was to have the eyes and lines of the worm in negative space. My considerations for the lines were to (1) use the lines to clearly show any overlapping areas, (2) try and make them as evenly spaced as possible in each worm, and (3) use them as intentionally as possible so that each glyph is still legible, while still being clear that it's a worm. The following glyphs below showcase some of my design considerations. For glyphs A and H, I struggled to find a way to bend the worm without it being too thick compared to the other glyphs, so for only these 2, I added a \"chunk\" in the middle. \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"digi-ill\">\n            <div class=\"sc-row1\">\n                <img src=\"@/assets/worm-squirm/ws-2.jpg\" class=\"img1\"/>\n                <img src=\"@/assets/worm-squirm/ws-3.jpg\" class=\"img1\"/>\n                <img src=\"@/assets/worm-squirm/ws-1.jpg\" class=\"img1\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            As the brief required an accompanying film featuring two talents, I worked with the team to explore how their stories could be told in parallel rather than separately. We designed a <b>click-to-switch video interaction</b>, where both talents’ journeys play concurrently, allowing users to toggle between Premium Economy and Business Class experiences.\n            This interaction became the backbone of the site, grounding all subsequent interactions within a single, cohesive narrative.\n\n            <video \n            src=\"/videos/04-Video-Toggle.mp4\"\n            controls\n            style=\"width:100%; margin-top: 80px;\"\n            ></video>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n       To make the dining experience interactive, we designed a <b>dish-to-destination matching game</b> where users guess each dish’s country of origin before seeing the context. This active participation makes learning more engaging, and helps users better remember the information, while highlighting SIA’s premium, destination-inspired meals to strengthen brand perception. \n        \n    \n        <video \n            src=\"/videos/02-Interactive-Quiz-Shorter.mp4\"\n            controls\n            style=\"width:100%; margin-top: 80px;\"\n            ></video>\n    </div>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            To simulate the feeling of moving through a cabin, we used a horizontal scroll interaction, allowing users to \"stroll\" down the aisle of a Premium Economy or Business Class cabin. \n            <br><br>\n            Before committing to the illustrations and animations, we systematically listed out the different proof points we wanted to cover, and their accompanying illustrations and interactions.\n        </div>\n        <poster key=\"list\" :poster=\"list\"></poster>\n\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            I animated the cabin illustrations (created by illustrator Alba), embedding micro-interactions that encourage exploration. These interactions were intentionally simple, focusing on discovery rather than instruction, to share SIA's extensive in-flight offerings.\n        \n            <video \n            src=\"/videos/03-Horizontal-Scroll-2.mp4\"\n            controls\n            style=\"width:100%; margin-top: 80px;\"\n            ></video>\n        </div>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">\n            While formal user testing was limited due to the nature of the campaign, internal feedback highlighted that the interactive elements made the experience surprisingly intuitive despite the amount of information presented.\n            <br><br>\n            One key takeaway for me was how small, playful interactions helped lower the barrier to engaging with information-heavy content, which can otherwise feel taxing.\n        </div>\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ?

From a quantitative online survey conducted by an independent research company, participants feedbacked that they came away with a stronger sense of SIA as a world-class airline with premium service and quality offerings, with notable uplifts in favourability, likelihood to recommend, and intent to fly for business purposes. \n        <br><br>One of the most satisfying outcomes was seeing the metrics confirm what we had hoped: users weren’t just clicking through the site — they were absorbing the information, exploring interactions, and leaving with a stronger understanding of SIA’s world-class offerings.\n\n        <br><br> The project received an <b>Honourable Mention on Awwwards</b>, recognising both its interaction design and storytelling approach.\n\n\n        </div>\n\n\n        <header :class=\"[mobileView ? 'header-2-m reveal' : 'header-2 reveal']\">Personal Reflection</header>\n        <div :class=\"[mobileView ? 'introduction-m reveal' : 'introduction reveal']\">Designing this campaign reinforced my belief that good digital experiences aren’t about showing everything at once, but about <b>guiding users through information at the right pace, and encouraging active participation</b>. My team and I approached each story with meticulous care, ensuring that we aligned with SIA's brand guidelines, while adding playful touches that reflected the feeling of being on a flight – exploring the cabin, discovering amenities and enjoying in-flight meals.\n            \n            <br><br>This project sharpened my interest in using interaction design not just to inform, but to help users feel curious to discover, and engaged as they explore a product.\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"see-more-div\">\n            <text :class=\"[mobileView ?
